Project made in React. The idea was to make a NIKE shop. Just for shop purposes, I have placed a few example shoes at the Contenfull server and fetch from app context.
The project is not fully ready. I'm currently finishing it, by cleaning the notifications from the console. 

The project includes:
- JS validation (live).
- backend validation (firebase) with the list of registered users(available from my firebase account)
- react-router-dom(to switch between pages)
- CSS transition(to make animation between pages)
- handle fetch responses and errors
- protected routes 
- is mobile friendly

If you want to see live-view of the application without npm-install please see it on netlify:

One more thing: I'm glad if you will check the code and for example indicate some mistakes that I made in code. I think that's the best way to improve your skills if someone more experienced shows you a better way..
