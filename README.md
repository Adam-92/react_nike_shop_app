# Project of React Nike Shop

Project made in React. It has a validation system on the JS side as well as on the back-end on the FIREBASE platform. 
Registered users can go to the login section and see the products (downloaded from the Contenful platform). 
Logging out also takes place with the use of FIREBASE. 
The project focuses not only on validation, but also on protecting the user through secured routes (private routes function, react-router-dom).
It all uses animations between new addresses (CSS Transition). The store is mobile friendly!
